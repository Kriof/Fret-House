    <h2>Hello, welcome to Fret house organiser!</h2>
    <p>
        As many of you know, fret houses are places where party never ends. Based on my custom experience and many stories heard from all over the world,
         one day a though came up to my mind. What would happen if people start to clean and make tidy in their houses in a regular time? Not only twice a year.
    </p>
    <p>
        That crazy idea was a spark, igniting a bonfire and lead to creating this app. Enjoy
